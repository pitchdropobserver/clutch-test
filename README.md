# clutch-test

## What you did
- working filters for car price & make
- working grid to display data 

## Problems or flaws you encountered
- grid layout: need to control img height when car photo fails during loading

## What you would do if you had another week to work on it
- react router to access carousel page
- server side endpoint for data fetching instead of hard coded data
- maybe fatness should at the reducers instead of action creators
- proper visual feedback for user selections, at filters and grid
- optimization: do a pass to make sure no uncessary rendering is happening. maybe cache loaded img
- implement loading animation for images
- over all styling
